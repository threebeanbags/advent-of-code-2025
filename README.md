# Advent of Code 2025

These are fun little exercises.

Clojure because I love it and never get to use it.
Rust because it's my latest jam.

Just enough to solve the problem, I don't go crazy with constants for everything and whatnot.

No AI allowed (my personal restriction for this -- but the Gemini TUI is hot stuff, and gptel is awesome)
